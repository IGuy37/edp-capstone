# Travelers EDP Capstone Project
The capstone project for the Travelers Engineering Development Program (EDP). This project implements a Searchable Enterprise Directory (SED) using the MERN stack and Python.

## Project Description
We created a React web application to allow employees to search an enterprise-wide employee directory. Employees can find others' names, job titles, where they work, phone numbers, their boss, and who they report to. They can also see the salary of everyone if they work in HR and they can see the salary of themselves and their subordinates.

We also created a Linear Regression model to predict an employee's salary based on their job location and title.

## Learning Goals
By completing this capstone project, we:
- Created a MERN stack application to implement the searching feature of the SED
- Created a Python Flask web server to train the Linear Regression model
- TODO
